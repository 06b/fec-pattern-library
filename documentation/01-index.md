title: FEC Pattern Library

This is the collection of styles and design patterns that make up <a href="https://beta.fec.gov">beta.FEC.gov</a>. Like the main site, the style guide is a work in progress. We don't yet have a full list of design patterns or complete documentation, but we're actively developing these resources as we build the site.

<a href="https://github.com/18f/fec-style/issues">Let us know</a> how we can improve.
